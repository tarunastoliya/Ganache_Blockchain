    <h1>DRM Checker</h1>
    <p>
      DRM through blockchain can be used to verify the authenticity of digital content and track the source of leaks. 
      Blockchain technology can provide a secure and tamper-proof record of the digital asset's history, 
      allowing publishers to identify the source of any leaks or unauthorized distribution. 
      Additionally, each token can be linked to a unique identifier that is difficult to forge, 
      enabling consumers to verify that the digital asset they have purchased is genuine and has not been tampered with. 
      However, DRM through blockchain has its own set of limitations and challenges, 
      including the requirement for significant computational resources and concerns around privacy and data protection.
